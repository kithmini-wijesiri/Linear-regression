# Linear-regression
Here is an example of we can formally describe the problem of linear regression, or the fitting of a representative line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) to a set of input/output data points. Regression in general may be performed for a variety of reasons: to produce a trend line (or - more generally - a curve) that can be used to help visually summarize, drive home a particular point about the data under study, or to learn a model so that precise predictions can be made regarding output values in the future.
